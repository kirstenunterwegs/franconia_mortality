# Study background

## Forest reorganization: implementation

Identify the aspects of the forest reorganization:

* in forest composition: **Reassembly**

    + **RA1**:  Dominant species (by rIVI): Will the dominant species under pre-disturbance under post-disturbance? Species change => indication for change
    + **RA2**: Tree species richness (counts): if richness under DIST is lower then REF => change   
    + **RA3**: Competition: shade tolerance CWM: Is the shade tolerance of community lower then before? => change  

* in forest structure: **Restructuring**

    + **RS1**: Stem density: Is the density lower then before? => change
    + **RS2**: Horizontal structure: Is the structure of gaps and tree spacing larger after disturbances? => change
    + **RS3**: Vertical structure: Is the mean number of layers under DIST higher then under REF?    

Evaluate by comparing the range of variability under REF condition (mean, SD) compared to the mean under DIST:

- Restructure  = (mean(REF) - mean(D))/SD_REF   or
- Restructure  = (mean(D) - mean(REF))/SD_REF

 -> The order of variables can change, to have the indication of change as positive (+) value.


*Combine indicators* by means of the individual indicators per each dimension (struture, composition).

# Data collection: summer 2022

##	Study sites selection
We have identified the triplets of the similar forest management history and site conditions. A triplet represents locally comparable sites of the same pre-disturbance conditions and management history. The triplet consists of three sites representing i) reference conditions, i.e., undisturbed forest; and sites affected by drought and ii) managed by salvage logging, or iii) left unmanaged, with standing dead trees. The minimal disturbance gap size was 0.05 ha (25 x 25m) with minimal gap width on the smallest side of 25 m and disturbance severity of >80% of removed basal area. In total, we identified 40 triplets. 

## 	Sampling design

At each study site, we have collected trees characteristics at two levels: within 4 m2 plot and in its nearest surroundings (distance from plot center: <15m). This approache allowed us effectively account for different tree heights classes and densities. Specifically, we have collected tree species, stem density, and a diameter at breast height (dbh) of individual trees at three height classes: forest regeneration (dbh: < 2 cm, height: < 2 m), advanced regeneration (dbh: 2-10 cm), and mature trees (dbh: > 10 cm). In each plot’s surrounding (within 15 m radius), we have recorded the distance to the nearest advanced regeneration and mature tree, its tree species, and dbh. 
The plots were randomly located along the sampling grid, with minimal distance between plots of 10 m. The sampling design aimed to capture the stem density at the plot level for forest regeneration, and within the plot surroundings using distance density estimation. The effective number of plots per site to correctly represent distance-based stem density was a priori tested using a simulation approach in R software (R Development Core Team 2019). We used a full factorial experimental design to test the sensitivity of the estimated stem densities of the number of plots (per stand from 4 to 100 plots, increasing by 2)  and stand size (from 0.05 ha to 1 ha). We tested simulated stands with different densities (from 1 to 10000 stems/ha) and repeated simulations 10 times. The mean predicted densities remained stable at 5 (for stand of 0.05 ha) to 15 plots per site (area of 1 ha, Fig. S2), allowing to accordingly scale up the number of plots per site. See full protocol for data collection as Supplementary material SX.

## Analyses

We have combined the collected tree characteristics to represent the community level information. We summed up the plot- and nearest-distance derived stem densities per plot [stem number/ha]. This represents a robust method to capture different types of forest structures differing in size and densities, and balances between the plots and its immediate surroundings. We have slope-corrected recorded stem densities. 
Specifically, for each plot, we have calculated stem density [number of trees/ha], relative species importance value [IV, scaled to 0-100%], based on species stem density and its basal area, and species richness, as a number of tree species per plot. We have used species-specific ecological characteristics derived by Niinemets and Valladares (2006) to calculate the community shade tolerance, weighted by IV. We have used the distance to the nearest tree and height classes of trees to derive the horizontal and vertical structure of the forest.

We have summarized the results to characterize the post-disturbance recovery of disturbed sites based on type of applied management, where the site was cleared (managed) or left unmanaged. Secondly, we have focused on pathways of forest reorganization sensu Seidl and Turner (2022). Following the conceptual ideas outlined by Seidl and Turner (2022), we assessed the propensity of forest reorganization based on post-disturbance forest vegetation relative to reference conditions (representing pre-disturbance state). We have used three indicators for each dimension of forest reorganization (structure, composition), standardized them using z-scores, and combined the obtained responses by means of averaging. The result is an integral indicator of the propensity for reorganization (for the categories resilience, reassembly, restructuring, and replacement) that can be compared across environmental conditions and forest types. The analysis is conducted at the level of individual sites, using the sample plots per site to consider the inherent variation in each property also under reference conditions. Lastly, we investigated how the how disturbance patch size and severity (in term of basal area removed) influence the site specific reorganization path.





# Study sites 

The number of samples triplets by dominant tree species. Each triplet has 3 management categories: 

- REF       - reference, undisturbed sites
- MAN       - managed
- UNM       - disturbed sites by drought, unmanaged

## Collected forest variables
 
Plot (4m^2):  

 - seedlings:
    +  regeneration < 1.3 m: BA = 0, 
    + regeneration 1.3m-2 m, estimated DBH = 0.8 cm, BA accordingly
 - advanced regeneration: 
    + DBH & height measured for each tree
 - mature trees:
    + DBH measured for each tree
 
 
Surroundings (<15m from the plot center):

 - nearest advanced regeneration: species
 - nearest mature tree: species, DBH
 
 
## Derived characteristics
 
### Tree density

Two approaches: 

 - density based on plot values (counts of trees/plot = 4 m2)
 - distance density estimation (based on nearest distance metrics)
 
Both metrics are slope corrected and recalculated to count of trees/ha.





### Species importance value

Calculate **species importance value**

**Importance Value** is a measure of how dominant a species is in a given forest area. 

 - *Relative density*, the number of individuals per area as a percent of the number of individuals of all species.
 - *Relative basal area*.  the total basal area of Species A as a percent of the total basal area of all species.  Basal area is the sum of the cross sectional area of all the trees of species A, measured at 4.5 ft. above ground. The forester actually measures diameter and then converts that number to basal area.
 
Each of these values is expressed as a percent, and ranges from 0 to 100.

The **Importance Value** is the sum of these three measures, and can range from 0 to 200. Scaled to [0-100] for comarison purposes. The frequency (i.e. the occurence of species per plot) is neglected, to obtain the variation between the plots within the site.

 **Importance value** calculated here considers the extent of the 4m2 plot and distance based on nearest distance measures (for advanced and mature regeneration in surroundings, up to 15 m). 
 
 
### Shade tolerance

Based on the collected information of the individual species, we have used the species ecological values published by Niinemets and Valladares (2006) to understand the shade tolerance index for the whole community. As weights, we have used species importance value.  

```{r set-theme, include=FALSE}
# set theme: plotting: 
theme_set(theme_bw())
theme_update(legend.position = 'bottom',
             aspect.ratio=1)

```

# Results

```{r triplet-count, echo=FALSE}
#print(getwd())
out_summary <- dat %>%
 group_by(dom_sp) %>%
 distinct(trip_n) %>%
 tally() %>%
 rename(species=dom_sp,
        triplets_count = n)

```



```{r sites-count, echo=FALSE}
n_sites <-
  dat %>%
  group_by(trip_n, dom_sp, manag, sub_n) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  nrow()

```

**Sites overview:** 

Triplets count:  **`r length(unique(dat$trip_n))`**

Total count of plots (4m2) per triplet&category : **`r n_sites`** plots



```{r print-summary, echo=F}
# print nice table in knitr
out_summary %>% knitr::kable("markdown")

```


## Post disturbance recovery & effect of management

In total, we have collected data on 1244 plots, aggregated over 40 triplets across Bavaria. 

Here we present them at the plot level (using violin plots) and averaged at the site level (using dot plot).

```


## Pathways of forest reorganization

Compare the REF conditions with Disturbed conditions (Managed, Unmanaged) using Z-score.

Indication of change of community after disturbance:

- **RA1: Dominant species importance value**: Reduced dominant species importance value
- **RA2: Tree species richness** :  Decrease in species richness  
- **RA3: Shade tolerance** Decrease in community weighted mean shade tolerance.
- **RS1: Stem density**Decrease in stem density.
- **RS2: Horizontal structure**: Increase in horizontal distances between trees (i.e., forest gaps)
- **RS3: Vertical structure**: Increase in number of vertical layers. 


### Evaluate change from REF condistions

## Drivers of forest reorganization

We consider additional auxiliary variables to explain the observed shift in the community restructuring/reassembly. 

**Auxiliary variables**:

- temperature
- precipitation
- temperature anomaly (2018-2020 compared to 1986-2015)
- precipitation anomaly (2018-2020 compared to 1986-2015)
- deadwood amount
- ground cover [% of bare soil]

We will predict the extend of change (Euclidean distance) by auxiliary variables by generalized linear models.  

[To be completed over coming months].
